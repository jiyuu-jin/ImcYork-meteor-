                                            <h5>SculpSure is a breakthrough FDA approved, non-invasive light based body contouring system designed to reduce stubborn fat in just 25 minute treatments. This laser technology targets and heats fat cells under the skin without affecting the skinâ€™s surface but raising the temperature of the fat cells and damaging their structural integrity. After the treatment, the damaged fat cells are removed permanently. They are naturally absorbed from your body through your lymphatic system. Since there is no downtime with SculpSure you can have one treatment done during your lunch break and return to work immediately. Patients will start seeing results as early as 6 weeks, with optimal results at 12 weeks.</h5>
